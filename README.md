# 📚 Personal Reading Analytics

A self-built, fully automated data pipeline with CI/CD governance, leveraging GitHub Actions and MongoDB event sourcing to transform raw reading data into actionable insights and interactive visualizations with zero infrastructure.

Beyond standard charts, it performs an **AI Delta Analysis** to generate a qualitative weekly narrative, answering three specific questions:

- **Velocity**: Are you reading faster or slower than usual?
- **Backlog Health**: Are you clearing old debt (>1 year) or just adding new noise?
- **Chronology**: Which specific years of content are you focusing on right now?

## 🌿 Engineering Principles

This project is built to reflect how I believe small, personal tools should work:

- **Zero infrastructure** → No servers or hosting costs. Runs entirely on GitHub (Actions + Pages).  
- **Fully automated** → Scheduled GitHub Actions keep data fresh, utilizing CI/CD governance for human-in-the-loop code review and merging.  
- **Observability first** → Uses an Event Sourcing pattern (MongoDB) to decouple extraction from analytics, ensuring full auditability and health monitoring.
- **Cost-effective** → Uses only free tiers (GitHub, Google Sheets API, MongoDB Atlas), proving powerful automation doesn’t require budget.

## 🏗 Architecture & Documentation

Unlike typical "script-based" scrapers, this system is architected for scale and maintenance using an **Event Sourcing** pattern.

- **Ingestion**: Python scripts harvest content and emit standardized events to a MongoDB immutable log.
- **Observability**: An external hub consumes these events to populate Grafana dashboards for system health monitoring.
- **Visualization**: Go binaries process the event stream, generate AI-powered summaries for historical context, and produce the static site.

### 📈 System Observability

To demonstrate operational maturity, I maintain a public **[Observability Hub](https://victoriacheng15.github.io/observability-hub/snapshots.html)**.
This separate dashboard visualizes the "health" of this pipeline (ETL status, error rates, latencies) without requiring Grafana authentication.

For deep technical details, architectural diagrams, and operational guides, please visit the **[Documentation](docs/README.md)**.

## 📊 What It Shows

**Key Metrics Section:**

- **Total articles**: Tracking total articles across currently supported sources
- **Read rate**: Percentage of articles completed with visual highlighting
- **AI Delta Analysis**: Multi-dimensional analysis of reading **Velocity** (pace), **Backlog Health** (clearing old debt vs. new noise), and **Chronology** (era of content focus) to provide narrative context beyond raw numbers.
- **Historical Archive**: A permanent record of past weekly snapshots, accessible via a context-aware selector to track progress over time.
- **Reading statistics**: Read count, unread count, and average articles per month
- **Highlight badges**: Top read rate source, most unread source, current month's read articles

**7 Interactive Visualizations (Chart.js):**

1. **Year Breakdown**: Bar chart showing article distribution by publication year
2. **Read/Unread by Year**: Stacked bar chart with reading progress across years
3. **Monthly Breakdown**: Toggle between total articles (line chart) and by-source distribution (stacked bar)
4. **Read/Unread by Month**: Seasonal reading patterns across all months
5. **Read/Unread by Source**: Horizontal stacked bars comparing progress per provider
6. **Unread Age Distribution**: Age buckets (<1 month, 1-3 months, 3-6 months, 6-12 months, >1 year)
7. **Unread by Year**: Identifies which years have the most unread backlog

**Source Analytics:**

- Per-source statistics with read/unread split and read percentages
- Substack per-author average calculation (total articles ÷ author count)
- Top 3 oldest unread articles with clickable links, dates, and age calculations
- Source metadata showing when each provider was added to tracking
