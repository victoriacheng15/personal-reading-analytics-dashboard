# 📚 Personal Reading Analytics Dashboard

A self-built fully automated reading analytics dashboard with zero infrastructure, refreshed automatically to turn personal data into actionable insights.

---

## 🌿 Design Philosophy

This project is built to reflect how I believe small, personal tools should work:

- **Zero infrastructure** → No servers, databases, or cloud costs. Runs entirely on GitHub (Actions + Pages).  
- **Fully automated** → Scheduled GitHub Actions keep data fresh—no manual runs or home servers.  
- **Transparent by default** → All code, data logic, and outputs are public. No black boxes.  
- **Sustainable & low-stress** → Simple pipeline, easy to maintain, no roadmap pressure. It evolves only when real needs arise.  
- **Cost-effective** → Uses only free tiers (GitHub, Google Sheets API)—proving powerful automation doesn’t require budget.

## 🛠️ Technical Overview

### Data Pipeline: Articles → Metrics → Dashboard

```mermaid

    A["Article Extraction - Python"] -->|Extract & Deduplicate| B["Google Sheets"]
    B -->|Read Articles| C["Metrics Calculation - Go"]
    C -->|Generate JSON| D["metrics/YYYY-MM-DD.json"]
    D -->|Read Metrics| E["Dashboard Generation - Go"]
    E -->|Generate HTML| F["index.html with Chart.js"]
    F -->|Deploy| G["GitHub Pages for Live Dashboard"]
```

**Article Extraction**: Python web scrapers extract articles from engineering sources, deduplicate, and store in Google Sheets

**Metrics Calculation**: Go program reads articles from Google Sheets, calculates metrics, outputs JSON

**Dashboard Generation**: Go program reads metrics JSON, generates interactive HTML with Chart.js visualizations, deploys to GitHub Pages
