  title: "📖 Origin Story"
  paragraphs:
    - "I used to follow a handful of engineering blogs, but checking each one for new posts became a chore, too many tabs, too easy to miss something. (Yes, I’ve definitely had 20+ tabs open at once… 😅)"
    - "So I built a simple script to automatically pull article titles, dates, and links into Google Sheets, inspired by early Levels.fyi’s “no database” approach. Everything in one place. No more tab-hopping."
    - "Later, I got curious: What if I could actually see my reading habits over time? Not to “optimize” productivity, but to understand where my attention really goes… and which blogs still earn it."
    - "That curiosity led me to build a lightweight analytics system in Go, powered by the same Python-collected data. The result? A personal reading analytics: a quiet mirror on my learning journey."
