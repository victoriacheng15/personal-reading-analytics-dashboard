        <h2 class="section-title">📖 Origin Story</h2>
        <div class="origin-story-box">
            <p>I used to follow a handful of engineering blogs, but checking each one for new posts became a chore—too
                many tabs, too easy to miss something. (Yes, I’ve definitely had 20+ tabs open at once… 😅)</p>
            <p>So I built a simple script to automatically pull article titles, dates, and links into Google
                Sheets—inspired by early Levels.fyi’s “no database” approach. Everything in one place. No more
                tab-hopping.</p>
            <p>Later, I got curious: <em>What if I could actually see my reading habits over time?</em> Not to
                “optimize” productivity—but to understand where my attention really goes… and which blogs still earn it.
            </p>
            <p>That curiosity led me to build a lightweight analytics system in Go, powered by the same
                Python-collected data. The result? A personal reading analytics—a quiet mirror on my learning journey.
